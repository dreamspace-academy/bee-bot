DreamSpace Academy is a non-profit social enterprise tackling local socio-economic and environmental challenges through challenge-based learning, grassroots innovation and impact venture building
Story
DreamSpace Academy was established in 2017 in Kallady, Sri Lanka by Kishoth Navaretnaraja and Aravinth Punch. For thirty years, the country had experienced many problems due to war, including challenges in how people lived, money, and nature. Although other countries provided assistance, it was clear that solutions from outside could not fix the real problems in Sri Lanka. 

DreamSpace Academy aimed to make things better by helping the people in Sri Lanka. The country required unique solutions to address its specific issues. In 2018, the Global Innovation Index identified Sri Lanka as less innovative in Asia compared to other Asian countries. Additionally, the economy struggled with persistent trade deficits in 2016 and 2017, where imports surpassed exports, underscoring the need for local economic solutions. 

One major problem facing Sri Lanka was the conflict between humans and elephants. In 2016 and 2018, there were 88 and 93 human deaths, respectively, due to interactions with elephants. During the same period, 279 and 319 elephants were killed due to human activities. This highlighted the need for finding long-term solutions that considered the specific challenges faced by humans and the environment. 

DreamSpace Academy believed that everyone in the country needed to work together to find solutions. Local people understood the problems best and could find the best solutions. DreamSpace Academy had four important ideas to guide them: firstly, to come up with new and smart ways to solve problems; secondly, to encourage people to start their own businesses to address local issues; thirdly, to teach people the things they needed to know to make things better; and fourthly, to bring everyone together and build trust. 

DreamSpace Academy had a simple goal: to make Sri Lanka a peaceful and united place. We aimed to help local communities come up with their own ideas to solve problems and improve the country. By doing this, We hoped to improve the economy and stop conflicts between people and the environment.
The mission of DreamSpace Academy is to achieve sustainable development goals through education, innovation and entrepreneurship by empowering underserved communities, protecting environmental ecosystems, fostering economic initiatives and facilitating peacebuilding. The vision of DreamSpace Academy is to build a self-sustaining ecosystem for local & international changemakers to co-learn, co-innovate, co-live, co-farm and co-produce, thereby co-creating next-generation enterprises to make Sri Lanka the biggest social & tech innovation hub in South Asia. The two pillars of DreamSpace Academy are our Social Mission and Business Venture. Through our social mission, we offer personalized empowerment, peacebuilding, community building, and well-being advocacy.

The journey within DreamSpace Academy's program unfolds in a series of strategic phases, each contributing to the growth and empowerment of aspiring changemakers. It all begins with "Changemaker Discovery," where the program launches with interdisciplinary workshops aimed at identifying individuals driven by a profound desire to enact positive change. Hailing from diverse backgrounds, these passionate changemakers share a common vision—to address pressing real-world challenges. Guided by their motivation to tackle local environmental and social issues, these individuals are identified as potential changemakers, the driving force behind transformative initiatives.
The subsequent phase, "Challenge-based Learning," propels the identified participants into a journey of skill acquisition. Engaging in labs spanning a wide array of disciplines—from photography to biotechnology these changemakers delve into immersive learning experiences. By embracing this diverse learning, they uncover their own unique domains of expertise, thus laying the solid groundwork for their transformative endeavors.
"Grassroots Innovation" marks the next phase, as these skilled changemakers armed with specialized knowledge venture into their communities for immersive research. They seek out pressing local challenges that resonate deeply with their aspirations. These innovative solutions are born from the very real-world needs they've identified, ensuring not only relevance but tangible impact.
Collaboration with international experts is central to the "Domain Expertise" phase. Drawing on a blend of global insights and local contexts, participants refine their solutions to greater heights. This collaborative approach bridges the gap between visionary concepts and pragmatic execution, yielding solutions that are both innovative and feasible.
Ultimately, the program reaches its zenith with "Impact-Venture Building." Changemakers transition from conceptualization to tangible, sustainable impact ventures. As they bring their ideas to life, they artfully balance their social missions with financial viability, ensuring that their projects are not only transformative but also capable of scaling sustainably.
The first three months are particularly significant, where identified changemakers rotate through various labs, gaining multidisciplinary skills that shape their capabilities. Following this foundational phase, they are empowered to pinpoint their passion and expertise, focusing their efforts on areas that align most closely with their aspirations.
